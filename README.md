## This is the HW1 of ML by Chien Yu Lin, 0450225, 林建宇

### How to run my program
* Use matlab or octave to run the hw1_0450225.m script
* It will progress train, test and cross validation version for train and test
* It will show the mse result for each approaches also
* If you just want to check the training result or testing result
* Just enter the train or target directory respectly
* and load the files train_result.mat, target_result.mat or predic_result.mat
* in the matlab or octave

### If you got error on loading the package statistic
* It's package for octave
* If you're using matlab, you can try to remove the lines
* "pkg load statistics" and "pkg unload statistics" in the ./train/train.m and ./train/train_cx.m
* Sorry for causing your inconvenience.
* Thanks
